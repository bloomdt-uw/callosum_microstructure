# callosum_microstructure

### Microstructure quantification of the corpus callosum.

Diffusion MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique, however it has low resolution which limits ability to directly identify underlaying microstructural properties. Using diffusion modeling it is possible to extract tissue properties from diffusion images. 

Can we build intuition about what these tissue properties say about the the microstructure of human white matter? For example if fractional anisotropy is high, mean diffusivity is moderate, and mean kertiosis is low what can be said about the white matter?

We choose the callosum as an anitomical basis as it has the benefit that much of its diffusion is lateral and thus faciliating the interpretation of the diffusion metrics.

We begin by looking at histological and simulation studies for the corpus callosum:

We attempt to find unique signatures, or patterns, in the diffusion tractometry metric profiles, that correlate to known histological structures. 

From this we could infer the hisological structures of other parts of white matter.
